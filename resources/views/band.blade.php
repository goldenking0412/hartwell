		<h3 id="who-we-are">History</h3>
		<p>Founded as a small distribution company in 1939, Hartwell Corporation has grown into a global leader specializing in the design, development, and manufacture of latches and latching systems for the aerospace industry. Virtually every aircraft flying today has a variety of Hartwell Latches aboard.</p>
		<p>Our strength and success is partly due to our philosophy of working side by side with aircraft and engine manufacturers to solve complex problems wherever access into the aircraft is required.  We have specialized in quick access latches since our WWII wartime invention of the Trigger-Lock® latch, which became the industry standard by dramatically reducing the time required to service an aircraft.</p>
		<p>Today we are tooled for over 20,000 versions of latches for various applications including engine cowlings, nacelles and thrust reversers, as well as interior and exterior access panels, cargo doors and interior stowage bins.</p>
